              <h3>Helps you solve complicated problems</h3>
              <div>
                During the ACM ICPC, you must solve difficult tasks, which are
                not for ordinary programmers. While you are training, you learn
                how to solve these out of the ordinary tasks. This helps prepare
                you for a job because you can adapt and solve various types of
                problems, in various types of situations.

                This is a very important skill, as most jobs will require you at
                some point to work in a team. Competitive programming helps you
                learn how to effectively work together, as you must work with
                others on your team to complete the same task. You learn how to
                assess your team membersâ€™ strength and weaknesses and
                effectively divide responsibilities between each other.
